        My passion lies in creating interactive software and systems that fosters idea sharing and personal expression. As a generalist, I am deeply invested in both technical and non-technical fields: hoping to bridge the gap between them. I believe that these fundamental aspects are crucial for developing meaningful products and research.

        While pursuing my studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, I have gained valuable experience in diverse contexts and political environments. This exposure has equipped me to tackle challenges head-on and adapt to various work environments.
