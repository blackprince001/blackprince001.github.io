The solution is boredom. Completely delete all the options. Invite Boredom. Make the thing you need to do the only option apart from Boredom and wait for the magic.

The lack of distractions invites the boredom you need.

If you have something you need to do, clear all the things that can act like a distraction.

Always remember; You can just do things.
