I've been trying to wrap my head around a specific quirk of human psychology: why are we so terrible at standing in someone else's shoes?

We assume empathy is a default setting. If I explain my side well enough, you should get it, right? Literature has a different view.reading David McRaney's book on this, and he points to the late psychologist Lee Ross.

Ross spent 40 years in conflict negotiation—Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland. He found that people almost never considered the other side's perspective until explicitly asked to.

It's not malice. It's cognitive economy. "Analogic perspective-taking"—imagining what it's like to be someone else—is high-level cognition. It burns metabolic energy. Unless prompted, our brains just won't do the work. We stick to our own reality because it's cheaper.

So the question becomes: How do we force that software to boot up? If we don't do it naturally, what triggers it?

Research suggests we're approaching it all wrong. We usually try to overwhelm people with data. But data doesn't trigger empathy; it triggers defense.

There's this concept of "Naive Realism"—we think we see the world as it is, and others are just biased. when you challenge that, the brain protects its identity.

To get someone to use their analytical mind, you have to bypass that threat detection first. literature on "Deep Canvassing" and "Street Epistemology" converges on one insight: arguments trigger defense, but stories and curiosity bypass it. 

By sharing vulnerable narratives or asking how a belief was formed rather than what it is, we shift the brain from combat to reflective puzzle solving to help dissect their visceral views well. 

Ultimately, we can't force someone to see our view; we have to build a "ramp" of questions that allows them to walk there themselves.
