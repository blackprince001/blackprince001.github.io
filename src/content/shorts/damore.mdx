When James Damore's memo first leaked, it sparked a binary war: you either believed the gender gap was purely biological or purely systemic. But as I've looked closer at the data and the culture, I've realized that both sides are missing the most critical piece of the puzzle.

**The problem with Damore's argument isn't that he looked at biology—it's that he stopped there.**

Damore treated biological differences like a final destination. He argued that because women might, on average, score higher in traits like agreeableness or an interest in people, they are naturally less suited for the high-stress, systemizing world of software engineering. To him, biology is the cause of the gap.

**I disagree. I believe biology is not the cause, but the "raw material" that we choose to misinterpret.**

**Here is where I believe Damore got it wrong:**

1. **He confuses Difference with Deficit**

Damore points to higher levels of agreeableness in women as a reason for lower salary negotiations and leadership representation. By doing this, he frames a biological trait as a professional weakness. He doesn't ask the more important question: Why does our corporate structure reward aggression and penalize collaboration? The problem isn't the trait; it's the way we've built the "game" to favor one specific biological expression over another.

2. **He ignores the Interpretive Marker**

Damore sees a biological marker—like a preference for people-oriented work—and assumes it's a barrier to coding. I see it as a signpost that society reads incorrectly. When a woman exhibits a "people-oriented" trait, our current culture often subjectively interprets that as a lack of technical focus. We are taking a neutral biological baseline and layering a biased interpretation on top of it.

3. **He treats averages as destiny**

While Damore acknowledges that distributions overlap, his conclusions still rely on the idea that tech as it exists today is a fixed, immovable environment that women must biologically adapt to. He fails to see that tech culture is a subjective social construct. If the environment is built to read certain traits as un-technical, the resulting gap isn't a biological inevitability—it's a failure of our interpretation.

**The Path Forward**

We don't need to deny biology to fight for equality. Instead, we need to realize that biology only provides the markers—it's our biased, subjective interpretation of those markers that creates the wall.

The goal is to stop arguing about whether the gap is "nature or nurture" and start looking at how we can change the way we value the traits that nature provides. We shouldn't be asking women to be less "agreeable" to succeed; we should be asking why our leadership models are so narrow that they can't see the value in it.
